### Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea was starting extremely small, like doing two push-ups after brushing your teeth. It shows that success grows from tiny wins, not big motivation. Small actions done daily can create lasting change. Progress feels simple and doable.

### Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together.
M is Motivation (desire to act). A is Ability (how easy it is), and P is Prompt (the trigger). Making the habit easier increases success. Ability matters more than motivation.

### Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

Celebrating creates a positive emotion in the brain. That good feeling connects to the habit and makes it stick. Emotion is what builds habits, not repetition alone. Small celebrations make the behavior automatic.

### Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The idea of improving just 1% every day stood out. Small improvements grow into big results over time. It removes pressure to be perfect. Consistency becomes more powerful than intensity.

### Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book explains that habits shape identity. Focus on becoming the type of person you want to be. Every small action is a vote for your future self. Identity-based habits last longer.

### Question 6: What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

Make the habit obvious and simple. Reduce friction and prepare your environment. Start with a very small version of the habit. Easy actions improve consistency.

### Question 7: What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

Remove cues and increase friction. Hide triggers from your environment. Add extra steps before doing the behavior. If it feels inconvenient, you will do it less.

### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of and explain the steps.

I want to read more. I will keep a book on my desk to make the cue obvious. I will start with one page to keep it easy. After reading, I will track it to feel satisfied.

### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of and explain the steps.

I want to reduce phone scrolling. I will keep my phone away from my study area. Turning off notifications makes it less attractive. Adding a time limit makes it harder to continue.
