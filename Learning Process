# Learning Process

### Q1 **What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**
It's basically learning something by trying to explain it in simple words like you're teaching someone who knows nothing about it.


### Q2 **In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
I found the story about how Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison used to relax with objects in their hands really interesting. They'd hold something while dozing off, and when it dropped they'd wake up with new ideas.


### Q3 **What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**
Focused mode is when you're concentrating hard on something specific, like solving a math problem or coding. Diffuse mode is more relaxed your mind wanders and makes unexpected connections between ideas. Both are important for learning and switching between them helps you understand things better.


### Q4 **According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?**
First break down the skill into smaller chunks. Then learn just enough to spot your own mistakes. Remove anything that stops you from practicing. Finally start practice for at least 20 hours.


### Q5 **What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**
I'll try to explain concepts in my own words before moving ahead to make sure I get them.I want to focus on one thing at a time. Planning to take short breaks to let things sink in properly. Also going to set personal deadlines for practice work so I don't rush everything at the last minute.
