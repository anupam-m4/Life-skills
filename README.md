# Firewall: 

## Introduction

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls traffic based on some rules and acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.

## Types of Firewalls

### Packet Filtering

Basics filters using IP addresses and ports.


### Stateful Inspection

Tracks active connection contexts for better security.

### Application Layer

Inspects packet content to block specific application-level attacks.

## Rules and Importance


The real strength of a firewall comes from how well it is designed and managed. Instead of allowing everything and reacting later, a good firewall blocks all traffic by default and only permits what is truly needed.
 This approach greatly reduces security risks. Since firewalls sit at the edge of a network, they play a crucial role in stopping attacks early. To keep up with modern threats, today’s firewalls use advanced techniques like deep packet inspection and threat intelligence to detect suspicious activity and protect systems from constantly evolving cyber attacks.
