## Q2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

Reflective listening means you repeat back what someone said in your own words to make sure you got it right. It's not just parroting their exact words - you're showing you actually understand their point by explaining it back to them.

The idea comes from Carl Rogers' therapy work. Basically you are double-checking that you're both on the same page instead of just assuming you understood. This matters because when people misunderstand each other problems don't get solved.

It works really well in counseling people open up more when they feel genuinely heard. Takes some practice but it builds way better communication.





## Q3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?

1. **Language barriers** - In a new place with a different language, it's hard to understand what people are saying. You need to find common ground to communicate properly.
2. **Prejudging** - When you assume you know what someone will say, you stop actually listening.
3. **Emotional reactions** - Getting defensive or triggered makes you focus on your response instead of what they're saying.
4. **Distractions** - Background noise, or trying to multitask splits your attention.
5. **Information overload** - Too much being said at once makes it hard to keep up.
6. **Lack of interest** - If the topic seems boring, it's tough to stay focused.




## Q4. What can you do to improve your listening?

1. **Find common ground** - Make sure you're both speaking the same language so everyone understands.
2. **Cut out distractions** - Put your phone or any gadget away and pick a quiet spot for important conversations.
3. **Ask when confused** - Don't pretend you got it. Just ask them to explain again.
4. **Be patient** - Let people finish talking without rushing them especially if there's a language gap.
5. **Drop your assumptions** - Stop thinking you know what they'll say and actually hear them out.
6. **Stay focused** - Keep your attention on them instead of planning what you'll say next.
7. **Take notes during meetings** - Write down key points so you don't forget details when you need them later.




## Q5. When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

1. **Topics I don't know** - If someone's discussing a movie I haven't seen or history I'm unfamiliar with, I just nod along.
2. **With seniors** - I usually agree with managers or teachers even when I think differently.
3. **Avoiding arguments** - When things might get heated, I back down and say "sure, whatever works."
4. **Group decisions** - If everyone else agrees, I don't bother sharing my concerns.
5. **When exhausted** - On bad days, I don't have the energy to speak up.
6. **Small choices** - Like picking where to eat I let others decide since it doesn't matter much to me.



## Q6. When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

1. **When I know I'm right** - If I'm 100% sure about something but still I am trying to make people to me believe it.
2. **During games** - When things don't go my way or teammates mess up I yell at them.
3. **Being ignored repeatedly** - If people don't listen after I've explained multiple times I get forceful.
4. **Defending loved ones** - When someone unfairly criticizes my family I got into that zone without thinking.
5. **Feeling disrespected** - If someone talks down I get confrontational fast.



## Q7. When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?


1. **With authority** - When I disagree with someone senior then sarcasm slips out instead of speaking directly.
2. **After arguments** - If I lose a debate but I'm still mad I go quiet.
3. **Getting dismissed** - When people ignore my input, I make snarky remarks about their ideas.
4. **Broken commitments** - When someone doesn't follow through I stay sweet but bring it up mockingly later.
6. **Group members** - I complain to others about someone particular instead of confronting them directly.


## Q8. How can you make your communication assertive?

1. **Use proper language** - Say "I feel" or "I need" instead of blaming others.
2. **Be direct** - Stop hinting and just say what you mean clearly.
3. **Watch your body language** - Make eye contact, stand straight, keep your voice steady.
4. **Say no without overthinking** - You don't need to over-explain or apologize for your boundaries.
5. **Listen first** - Let them finish, then state your point calmly.
6. **Stay respectful** - Be firm without attacking or being mean.
